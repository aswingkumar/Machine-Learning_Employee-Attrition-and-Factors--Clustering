# Employee Attrition and Factors- Using Clustering  Model:
## Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating systems capable of learning from data and making decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns and insights from data, enabling systems to improve their performance on a specific task over time.
## Clustering in ML
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique that organizes similar data points into groups, or clusters, based on their characteristics, without relying on predefined labels or categories. Unlike supervised learning, clustering focuses on identifying patterns and relationships within the data autonomously. The goal is to group data points such that those within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

Clustering in the context of machine learning is an unsupervised learning technique used to group a set of data points into clusters (or groups) based on their similarity. The goal of clustering is to organize data in such a way that:
Intra-cluster similarity (similarity within a cluster) is maximized: Data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other.
Inter-cluster dissimilarity (difference between clusters) is maximized: Data points in different clusters are as distinct as possible.
Clustering is used when the dataset does not have labeled outcomes, making it an exploratory data analysis technique. It helps identify patterns, structures, or groupings in data that may not be immediately apparent.
## Key Clustering Algorithms
1. K-Means Clustering
- Explain the concept of centroids and assigning points.
- Mention its simplicity and use for well-defined clusters.
2. Hierarchical Clustering
- Explain its structure (dendrogram).
- Use case: when the number of clusters is unknown.
3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
- Explain how it identifies clusters based on density.
- Advantage: works well for arbitrary shapes.
4. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Based on probabilistic models.
- Suitable for overlapping clusters.
